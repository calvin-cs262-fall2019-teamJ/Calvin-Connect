When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Export** your project and use it with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html).

Projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the **Embed** button.
