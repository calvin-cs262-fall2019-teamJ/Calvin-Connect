Calvin Connect Client
Calvin Connect is a networking app that allows CS alumni and students to grow their professional networks and organize events. The app will be created with the aim of seeing a thriving community of professionals that helps its members grow through collaborative projects and mentoring opportunities. Unlike other networking apps, our app allows users to connect to a narrower, more intimate group of professionals with shared values and experiences (going to Calvin). It also allows users to recruit interested parties for collaboration on projects by hosting a “Pitch Page”. Additionally, it also matches alumni interested in mentoring, giving career advice, or informational interviews with students based on their background, interests, and career goals.
