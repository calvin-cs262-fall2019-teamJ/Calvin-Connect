# Calvin Connect
Calvin's Career Center says that "approximately 65-75% of jobs are filled through networking, which makes networking one of the most effective means of finding employment". Connections = Opportunities. Calvin's network of alumni is a great place for students and alumni alike to begin or continue growing their professional networks, but it is underutilized. Calvin Connect will help to build a virtual community for both Calvin students and alumni by creating connections, fostering relationships, promoting collaborative projects, and enabling mentorships. Unlike other networking apps like LinkedIn, Calvin Connect focuses on the shared values and experiences of Calvin students and alumni, which allows for an environment that builds upon the current, thriving Calvin community. 

Current students can use the app to find mentoring relationships, receive career advice, or conduct informational interviews with alumni based on their background, interests, and career goals. Alumni can use the app to find new employees or interns, get updates on Calvin's news, and connect with fellow Alumni for innovative venture. Faculty can use the app to keep track of alumni and enhance student-alumni connections. Furthermore, it provides support for anonymous postings, which helps to prevent bias and focus more on the content of the post rather than the person posting.

The technology platform we are using is REACT-Native supporting both Android and iOS providing us a copious amount of amazing components, and themes to use for our mobile app which helps us look for more modern, sleek designs for the users.
