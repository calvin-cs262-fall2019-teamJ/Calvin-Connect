# Calvin Connect
Calvin Connect is a networking app that creates a virtual community for the Calvin students and Calvin alumni. The ultimate aim of the app is to see a thriving community of professionals that helps its members grow through collaborative projects and mentoring opportunities in the Calvin World amongst the student and alumni.


Unlike other networking apps, our app allows users to connect to a narrower, more intimate group of professionals with shared values and experiences going to Calvin. It also allows users to recruit interested parties for collaboration on projects by hosting a “Pitch Page”. Additionally, it also matches alumni interested in mentoring, giving career advice, or informational interviews with students based on their background, interests, and career goals. A feature of our feed that differentiates us from other networking/social applications, is that the posts will remain anonymous to prevent bias and focus more on the content of the post versus the person posting.

The technology platform we are using is REACT-Native supporting both Android and iOS providing us a copious amount of amazing components, and themes to use for our mobile app which helps us look for more modern, sleek designs for the users.
