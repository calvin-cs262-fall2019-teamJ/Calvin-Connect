# Sample Snack app

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by clicking the **Run** button or use the simulator by clicking **Tap to Play**. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Export** your project and use it with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html).

The technology platform we are using is REACT-Native supporting both Android and ios. This platform is great for developing mobile apps, because of how fast it builds after it automatically updates the code. The build makes it easier for the programmers to see immediate results and detect any problems throughout the process. It also provides us a copious amount of amazing components, and themes to use for our mobile app which helps us look for more modern, sleek designs for the users.
