# Calvin Connect
Many placement opportunities can come from the alumni network. However, it is being under-utilized because students do not know how to connect. Calvin Connect will help to build a virtual community for both Calvin students and alumni by fostering connections, promoting collaborative projects and enabling mentoring relationships. Unlike other networking apps like LinkedIn, Calvin Connect focuses on the Calvin community with its shared values and shared experiences, which allows it to build upon the current, thriving Calvin community. Furthermore, it provides support for anonymous postings, which helps to prevent bias and focus more on the content of the post rather than the person posting.

Current students can use the app to find mentoring relationships, receive career advice, or conduct informational interviews with alumni chosen based on their background, interests, and career goals. Alumni can use the app to find new employees or interns, get updates on Calvin's news, and connect with fellow Alumni for innovative venture. Faculty can use the app to keep track of alumni and enhance student-alumni connections.

The technology platform we are using is REACT-Native supporting both Android and iOS providing us a copious amount of amazing components, and themes to use for our mobile app which helps us look for more modern, sleek designs for the users.
