# Calvin Connect
Connections are opportunities, and yet connections between Calvin's alumni and students are underutilized. Calvin Connect will help build a virtual community for both Calvin students and alumni by creating connections, fostering relationships, promoting collaborative projects, and enabling mentorships. Unlike other networking apps like LinkedIn, Calvin Connect focuses on the shared values and experiences of Calvin students and alumni, which allows for an environment that builds upon the current, thriving Calvin community. Furthermore, it provides support for anonymous posts, which helps users to avoid implicit bias and focus more on the content of the post rather than the person posting.

Current students can use the app to find mentoring relationships, receive career advice, or conduct informational interviews with alumni based on their background, interests, and career goals. Alumni can use the app to find new employees or interns, get updates on Calvin's news, and connect with fellow Alumni. Faculty can use the app to keep track of alumni and enhance student-alumni connections.

To build this app, we are using REACT-Native, a javascript-based platform that supports both Android and iOS and provides sleek designs for the users.
